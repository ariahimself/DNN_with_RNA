- Group_selection.py is the original group selection
- Group_selection2.py is the version we add feature selection then but only maximize I(Xs; Y)
- Group_selection3.py is the version we add feature selection maximize I(Xg; Y) + I(Xs; Y)
- Group_selection4.py is the version we add feature selection maximize I(Xg; X) + I(Xs; Y)

- Group_selection_new.py is the version we extend from Group_selection.py, added separate function approximator for each group and then concatenate the output super features.
